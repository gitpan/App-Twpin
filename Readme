        twpin config -u username -p password

DESCRIPTION
    "twpin" is a script for you to access twitter from command line

    twip <http://code.google.com/p/twip/> is a twitter API proxy in PHP.
    This script is created mainly because I can not find a good twitter
    client that supports this proxy

    Note on the recent OAuth-Supported twip, you can not use your email to
    access twitter, so always use Screename as your username to login

    Configration file is located at $HOME(or $Bin on MSWin32)/.twpinrc, you
    can just edit this file and add your username/password there.

    By default, the term encoding is set to utf8. If you are using other
    encodings, set 'encode = STH' in the configuration file(or use 'twpin
    config -e').
